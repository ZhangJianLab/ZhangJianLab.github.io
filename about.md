I am currently a financial economist at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporate (FDIC). I also enjoy teaching and am an adjunct professor for Text Mining for Economics and Finance at the University of Maryland in the Robert H. Smith School of Business. In July 2018, I finished my PhD in Economics from the Universitat Pompeu Fabra and Barcelona Graduate School of Economics. I started my academic career in mathematics, with a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from University of California, Berkeley. I spent some time working alongside central banks through an 8 month visit in Germany at the Deutsche Bundesbank and with a current research project with the Banco de la Rep&uacute;blica of Colombia. Previously, I did internships in the credit department of Moody's Analytics and in various financial companies, including investment funds. Outside of economics and finance, I like learning about natural language processing, innovations in machine learning, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and improv comedy.
